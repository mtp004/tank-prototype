CHANGES LOG, DATE: 11/16/2024
Known bugs: 
    When stress testing the capabilities of the object pooling system, when there is a significant amount of shell collision in a short amount of times, shell sometimes register collision twice before they get disable, which is not how it is suppose to work, as the shell should get disable immediately after the first collision, leaving to chance for the collider to register another collision. The result is the shell calling ReleaseObject() twice in a very short duration, which leads to the poolIndex variable reaching -1 in the function, resulting in a IndexOutOfRangeException, this is a Unity limitation.
